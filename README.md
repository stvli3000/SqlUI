# SqlUI
Hello 2017! Happy New Year to everyone! Let celebrate it by a introducing a new program  \(^_^)/ 

SqlUI, a tiny 50KB GUI for SQL query. Still in prototype, but be able to perform select and update, include manually typing new row(s) by update feature:

	- Show Table : Perform "select * from table", and pass the query to Query text box
	
	- Edit Table : Update database base on the table's contents. Please remember select ALL COLUMNS before editing, or may miss values.
	
	- Execute Query : Execute the query text box's contents.
	
However, just found out that it requires minimum .Net4, which is not sutible for orginal Windows 7. Not sure if it is worth while to continue developing. 

It is still good to have a tiny one to check out the results in database, when just doing program developing. 

Presume it is a new year gift  ^o^

Happy New Year!
